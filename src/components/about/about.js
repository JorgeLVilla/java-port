    <p>
            I am a Front-End Developer living in San Diego, California. I am very passionate about everything that I do,
            and love to create things with other people.

    <p>
        In my free time I am usually playing my guitar along to some old blues songs, or playing video games. I also
        enjoy training in JiuJitsu and learning new technologies.

        I am always excited to work on awesome projects, and push the boundaries of web and app development.
